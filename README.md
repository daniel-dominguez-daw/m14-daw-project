## How to run this project locally

First you need to setup your environment variables.

You must ask the AWS (COGNITO) credentials to the project owner <cf19daniel.dominguez@iesjoandaustria.org>

Copy `.env.example` into `.env` on the root directory

Edit your .env with the proper credentials

Add into your /etc/hosts the following: `127.0.0.1 jdam14dual.org`

run `npm start`

Open in your browser `https://jdam14dual.org:3000/` it will work with localhost too but some api redirects will fail without editing hosts file
